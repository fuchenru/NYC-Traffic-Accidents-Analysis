# NYC Traffic Accidents Analysis

This project analyzes traffic accidents data in New York City in 2020. The goal is to understand patterns and trends in traffic accidents and identify factors that contribute to accidents.

The project includes data cleaning and preparation, exploratory data analysis, regression analysis, and visualizations. The main tools used in the project are R and ggplot2 package.

## Data

The data used in this project is obtained from NYC Open Data portal. The dataset includes information about traffic accidents that occurred in New York City from January 2020 to December 2020.

## Analysis

The project is divided into several parts:

- Data Cleaning and Preparation: The data is cleaned and prepared for analysis. This includes removing missing values, converting data types, and creating new variables.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Basic statistics and visualizations are used to understand patterns and trends in the data. This includes mapping accidents across the city, analyzing accidents by borough and time of day, and examining the number of accidents per month.
- Regression Analysis: A regression model is used to predict the number of persons injured in a traffic accident based on the borough in which the accident occurred. The results of the regression analysis are interpreted and discussed.
- Visualizations: A number of visualizations are created to summarize and present the results of the analysis. These include maps, bar charts, and line plots.

## Requirements

- R
- ggplot2 package
- dplyr package
- tidyr package

## Conclusion

This project provides insights into traffic accidents in New York City in 2020. The analysis reveals patterns and trends in the data and identifies factors that contribute to accidents. The project highlights the importance of data analysis and visualization in understanding complex phenomena such as traffic accidents, and demonstrates the power of R and ggplot2 in carrying out such analyses.
