# SSC442-Final-Project

Group member: Peter Fu Chen, Mike Liu

This project is focused on analyzing the data on motor vehicle collisions that were reported by the New York City Police Department from January to August of 2020. The dataset contains a comprehensive record of each collision, including details such as the date, time, and location of the accident, as well as additional data.

The primary objective of this analysis is to compare the percentage of total accidents by month, in order to identify trends and changes over time. This will be achieved by utilizing various statistical tools and methods, such as data visualization through maps, to demonstrate the frequency of accidents in different boroughs of New York City.

Additionally, the analysis will also provide insights into the most common streets, days, and times when accidents are likely to occur. This information will be useful for law enforcement officials, traffic engineers, and city planners to understand the contributing factors to the accidents and implement effective safety measures to prevent future accidents.

The end goal of this project is to provide recommendations to the City of New York based on the findings of the analysis. These recommendations will be based on the most common accident hotspots, times, and contributing factors, and will help the city implement effective measures to reduce the number of accidents in the future.

To achieve this goal, the project will use advanced statistical analysis techniques to identify trends and patterns in the data. These techniques will include machine learning algorithms, such as clustering and regression, to identify the most significant factors that contribute to the accidents.

The project's outcome will have significant implications for the city's transportation and public safety policies, as it will provide insights into the causes of accidents and how they can be prevented. The findings of this analysis will be presented in a detailed report, which will be made publicly available on the project's Github repository.
